.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rrrestore
[\fB\-d\fR \fIday-of-month\fR]
[\fB\-f\fR ]
[\fB\-help\fR ]
[\fB\-N\fR \fIdatabase_name\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rrrestore
restores the Accord RentRoll database from a backup.  The data 
restored must have been generated by rrbkup(1).  By default,
.B rrrestore
looks for a file named bkup/rentroll\fIdd\fR.sql.gz where \fIdd\fR represents
the zero-filled day of the month number from the system date. The base
filename (rentroll\fIdd\fR) can be overridden using the -f option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.IP "-d day-of-month"
If this option is not specified then
today's day-of-month as specified by 
.Bdate(1)
is used. The day-of-month value must be in the range 1 to 31 or the script
will reject it.
Note that backups are stored by the day of the month. If the backup for today
has not yet been made and today's day-of-month value is used, then the data in the
back up will be a month old.
.IP "-f base_filename"
Use base_filename as the base file name. For example, "-f xyz" would result
in restoring the backup file bkup/xyz.sql.gz
.IP "-help"
Lists the command options to stdout.
.IP "-N database_name"
The default name for the production database is "accord".  For testing the
standard name is "accordtest".
